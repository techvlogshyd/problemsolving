Explanation: 3 + 7 + 6 + 9 = 25

7. Java Program to find maximum and minimum occurring character in a string.

8. Java Program to find all subsets of a string

9. Given a boolean 2D array of n x m dimensions where each row is sorted.
Find the 0-based index of the first row that has the maximum number of 1's.
Example 1:
Input:
N=4, M= 4
Arr[][] = (
(0, 1, 1, 1),
(0, 0, 1, 1),
(1, 1, 1, 1),
(0, 0, 0, 0))
Output: 2

10. Write a Java program that accepts three numbers and prints "All numbers are equal" if all three numbers are equal, "All numbers are different"
if all three numbers are different and "Neither all are equal or different" otherwise.
Test Data
Input first number: 2564
Input second number: 3526
Input third number: 2456
Expected Output:
All numbers are different

11. Write a Java Program to find the duplicate characters in a string.

12. Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array
Example 1:
Input:
N= 6
A[] = (3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167)
Output:
min = 1, max = 10000

13. Write a program in Java to display the n terms of odd natural number and their sum
Input number of terms is: 5
Expected Output:
The odd numbers are:
1
3
5
7
9
The Sum of odd Natural Number upto 5 terms is: 25

14. Write a Java program to find the number of days in a month.
Input a month number: 2
Input a year: 2016

15. Length of the longest substring without repeating characters
    Input: "ABCDEFGABEF"
    Output: 6 (The longest substring without repeating characters are "BDEFGA" and
    "DEFGAB", with length 6)
    Input: "GEEKSFORGEEKS"
    Output: 7 (The longest substring without repeating characters are ????KSFORG and "KSFORGE", with length 7)

16. Java Program to find maximum and minimum occurring character in a string.

17. Java program to find duplicate char in string using Hasmap

18. Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
    (1,3,5,6} target = 5

19. Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
    Input: strs = ["flower",
    , "flow", "flight"|Output: "f"
    If there is no common prefix, return an empty string".

 20. Minimum and maximum elements in the array

 21. Find the 2 most frequent numbers in the array sample input (1,1,2,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,7,0,1,1)
     output (2,5)

 22. Balanced or not balanced paranthesis
     Input: exp = "COKHI0010)"
     Output: Balanced
     Explanation:

23. Get all the negative numbers in the array to the end of array input:- (1, 2, 3, -1,-2,-4,4,5,6,7} output - (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,-1,-2,-4}

24. valid IP address consists of exactly four integers separated by single dots. Each integer is between 0 and 255 (inclusive) and cannot have leading zeros.
• For example, "O.1.2.201" and "192.168.1,1" are valld IP addresses, but "0.011.255.245", 192.168.1.312" and 192.168@1.1" are invalid IP addresses.
Given a string s containing only digits, return all possible valid IP addresses that can be formed by inserting dots into s. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in s. You may return the valid IP addresses in any order.
Example 1:
Input: s = "25525511135"Output: ["255.255.11.135","255.255.111.35"]
Example 2:
Input: s = "0000"Output: ["0.0.0.01
Example 3:
Input: s = "101023" Output: ["1.0.10.23", "1.0.102.3", "10.1.0.23", "10.10.2.3", "101.0.2.3"]
Constraints:
• 1<= s.length <= 20
